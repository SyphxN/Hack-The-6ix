# Beat 'em Up!
A fighting inspired rhythm game!

# **Features:**
- Handmade sprites and art assets - crafted with love <3
 - MIDI support, with the ability to rebind any input to virtually anything (drums, piano, guitar, kazoo, chair).
 - Custom game engine!
	 - Built from the ground up using p5.js as a renderer
	 - Versatile enough that 12 different maps were included in this release :0
	 - Excellent audio sync provided your device can run 60fps consistently
 - Responsive interface AND built for the web - works on almost any resolution and any device (even mobile too, which will be fully supported in the future!)

# **WIP/Planned Features:**
- Full mobile support (will work at the moment provided a MIDI device is connected, but touch support soon)
- Modifications (NoFail, DoubleTime, HalfTime, Hidden, etc...)
	- NoFail is enabled by default for demo purposes (and we also suck at the game)
- Local/Online leaderboard
